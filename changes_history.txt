v1.1.6
======

1) Added more functions in the EnvmicroBtransformer class
2) Corrected the sequencing order

v1.1.5
======

1) Fixed a bug in the BioTransformerExecutable class to resolve a NullPointerException occurring when running the sequence option using SD files.


v1.1.4
======
1) Added capabilities to identify metabolites (-cid) upon running a user-specified, ordered sequence of biotransformation steps.
2) Created a universal biotransformer that facilitates the simulation of biotransformation sequences
3) Solved an issue that resulted to empty results when running biotransformer sequences containing environmental microbial degradation modules.
4) Renamed a few functions
5) Updated the pom file, regenerated the Java Documentation

v1.1.3
======
1) Added capabilities to run a user-specified, ordered sequence of biotransformation steps. e.g. 'cyp450:2; phaseII:1' for a sequence of 2 CYP450 metabolism steps, followed by 1 step of cojugation.
2) Updated license terms wrt to the environmental microbial degradation module. USers must cite enviPath, when using the module. If using BioTransformer's environmental microbial degradation module 
for commercial purposes, make sure to obtain the proper license from EnviPath (https://envipath.org/).

v1.1.2
======
1) Updated the algorithm for the superbio, and hgut options. Polyphenols are processed differently.
2) Added new chemical classes
3) Updated the use of classification information for substrate-specificity prediction.
4) Fixed an issue with the parsing of masses for compound identification for 'env' and 'superbio' options (BioTransformerExecutable).
5) Updated validation protocol for command-line queries.
6) Improved error capture for identification tasks, and prediction tasks.
7) Moved some classification functions from ChemStructureExplorer to ChemicalClassFinder. 

v1.1.1
======
1) Moved the database folder to src/main/resources/.
2) Updated the BioSystem's code and the pom file  so that database files are imported as Resource streams.
3) Updated the main class, so queries (metabolism prediction or metabolite identification tasks) are run for one compound at the time. So far, BioTransformer stops if it fails on one compound, and returns results for all successful predictions.
4) Updated the README. file
5) Updated the install script to cp the /jar file to the root folder instead of bin/.

v1.0.0
======
1) Updated simulateGutMicrobialMetabolism() in HGutBTransformer to ensure list of biotransformations is added only if not null.
2) Updated the POM file to add dependencies for phaseIIFilter and CypReact.
3) Added a script to compile and package BioTransformer using maven.
4) Added a version package that is used in the main class
5) Updated the README file.
