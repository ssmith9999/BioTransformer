# BioTransformer's README

***************************************************************************************************
This is version 1.0.5 of BioTransformer. BioTransformer is a software tool that predicts small molecule metabolism in mammals, their gut microbiota, 
as well as the soil/aquatic microbiota. BioTransformer also assists scientists in metabolite identification, based on the metabolism prediction. Please make sure to download the folders database and supportfiles, and save them in the same folder as the .jar file.

BioTransformer is offered to the public as a freely acessible software package. Beside the prediction software, a manually curated database called BioTransformerDB is also available. Use and re-distribution of the these resources, in whole or in part, for commercial purposes requires explicit permission of the authors and explicit acknowledgment of the source material (BioTransformer) and the original publication (see citation). We ask that all users of the BioTransformer software tool or BioTransformerDB to cite the BioTransformer reference in any resulting publications.

                                     input queries.

(* ) While the 'superbio' option runs a set number of transformation steps in a
pre-defined order (e.g. deconjugation first, then Oxidation/reduction,
etc.), the 'allHuman' option predicts all possible metabolites from any
applicable reaction(Oxidation, reduction, (de-)conjugation) at each step.


(** ) For the environmental microbial biodegradation, all reactions (aerobic and anaerobic) are reported, and not only the aerobic biotransformations (as per default in the EAWAG BBD/PPS system).


*********
Examples:
*********

1) To predict the biotransformation of a molecule from an SDF input using the human super transformer (option superbio) and annotate the metabolites with names and database IDs (from PubChem), run

java -jar biotransformer-1-0-5.jar -k pred -b superbio -f sdf -i #{input file name} -o #{output folder} -a.
      
      - For each of the query molecule in the input file, an outputfile will be created with the list of corresponding metabolites.

2) To predict the 2-step biotransformation of Thymol (a monoterpene) using the human super transformer (option allHuman) using the SMILES input, run

java -jar biotransformer-1-0-5.jar  -k pred -b allHuman -f smiles -i "CC(C)C1=CC=C(C)C=C1O" -o #{replace with output file name} -s 2

Currently, the outputfile is SDF per default.

3) Identify all human metabolites (max depth = 2) of Epicatechin ("O[C@@H]1CC2=C(O)C=C(O)C=C2O[C@@H]1C1=CC=C(O)C(O)=C1") with masses 292.0946 Da and 304.0946 Da, with a mass tolerance of 0.01 Da. Provide an annotation (Common name).

java -jar biotransformer-1-0-5.jar  -k cid -b allHuman -f smiles -i "O[C@@H]1CC2=C(O)C=C(O)C=C2O[C@@H]1C1=CC=C(O)C(O)=C1" -o #{replace with output file name} -s 2 -m "292.0946;304.0946" -t 0.01 -a
    
    - DO NOT forget the quotes around the SMILES string or the list of masses.
